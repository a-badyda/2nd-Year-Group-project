Within the java programing the data is stored in a number of ways, a major way that data will be handled is through enums; requests will be handled through this and will be stored as either battle, breed, or friend, and the states of these requests will also be stored as enums, being either accepted, viewing, pending, or declined. Also stored as enums will be the statuses of monsters, thusly each monster status will be handled as normal, sick, dead, or happy.  Breed considers the different types of monster that we plan to be breeding with each other, and this therefore will be stored as an enum with the value of slime, beast, demon, dragon, serpent, or ghost.
Array Lists will also be used, but only, as far as designed, in private instances, so there will be no public instances that need to be explained in class diagrams. Otherwise, usernames, passwords, and the like will be handled in private strings and variable types as are appropriate.
